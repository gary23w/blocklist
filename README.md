Welcome to the Blocklist - the ultimate list of shame for units that have been detected by our trusty sentries!

Our sentries have been working tirelessly to keep the good folks safe from any nefarious characters lurking around. And boy, have they been busy! They've been detecting all sorts of units with bad intentions - from spambots and malware to misconfigured systems and outdated software.

But fear not, these units are not getting away with their mischievous ways! Once detected, they get added to our Blocklist - the virtual naughty step for digital troublemakers. And let's just say, it's not the place you want to end up.

Once on the Blocklist, these units are subject to a whole host of consequences. They might find themselves blocked from accessing certain websites or applications, or they could experience slower download speeds or more frequent captcha challenges. And that's just the beginning - our sentries are always on the lookout for new and creative ways to punish those on the Blocklist.

So, if you're a unit with malicious intent, beware - our sentries are watching, and the Blocklist is waiting for you. And for the rest of us law-abiding digital citizens, rest easy knowing that our sentries are working hard to keep the internet a safe and happy place.
